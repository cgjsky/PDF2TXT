In the renovation project of the 2nd-13th floors of the Asian Games Village Hotel, all the original 
non-energy-saving  products  were  replaced  with  a  total  of  6,800  metres  of  LED  energy-savinglight strips; 396 windows were replaced with double-layer hollow glass made of broken-bridgealuminium;  all  the  old  pipes  of  water  supply,  drainage,  heating  and  air  conditioning  werereplaced; and new rock wool materials were used for the internal insulation of the facade.In order to solve the problem of running and dripping caused by the ageing of the system, partof the domestic hot and cold water, heating and air-conditioning pipelines in the western part ofthe flat were renewed and the pipelines were insulated, with a total of 480 metres of pipelinesbeing renewed.The  exterior  windows  of  the  marketing  centre  of  Block  C  were  renovated  with  double-layer  hollowglass made of break-bridge aluminium, which has good heat insulation and heat preservation effect,reducing cold radiation and saving energy consumption.Established  a  valid  inventory  list  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Notice  on  theEnergy  Conservation  Monitoring  Work  of  Beijing  Development  and  Reform  Commissionfor  Beijing  North  Star  in  2020,  collected  and  provided  relevant  information  efficiently  andaccurately,  and  gradually  included  the  eliminated  equipment  in  the  annual  renovation  plan  asrequired by the Company.According  to  the  requirements  of  the  Beijing  Energy  Conservation  Supervision  Brigade,  theapartment's  existing  List  of  High  Energy-Consuming  and  Outdated  Mechanical  and  ElectricalEquipment (Products) to be Phased Out (Batches I, II, III and IV) included equipment of 20KWand  above  to  be  phased  out;  2  sets  of  energy-saving  dry-type  transformers  were  renewedand  the  renewal  of  2  transformers  in  Block  L  were  included  in  the Apartment  ManagementCompany's  2021  Project  Plan  for  the  Improvement  and  Expansion  of  Held Assets;  4  sets  ofmotors for air supply and smoke exhaust fans in the underground garage were removed.Green Office and Environmentally Friendly OperationIn terms of green office, in May 2020, the Public Facilities Management Company issued the Notice on the Issuanceof the Work Plan of the North Star Utility Management Branch on "Living a Tight Life", which clearly put forward theimplementation  rules  on  green  office,  paper  use,  no-paper  and  optimisation  of  equipment  and  facilities  operationefficiency.

includes purchased electricity and heat consumption.The greenhouse gas emission in 2020 is significantly lower than that in 2019 due to the impact of epidemic situation and remarkable effect 
of  energy  conservation  and  carbon  reduction.  The  calculation  scope  of  greenhouse  gas  in  2020  and  2019  is  expanded  on  the  basis  of

consumption data was based on the amount of purchased electricity and fuels consumed and the relevant conversion factors provided

The decrease of total water consumption in 2020 is mainly due to the company's active promotion of green transformation and various 
water-saving measures during the Reporting Period, as well as the decrease of conference and exhibition activities, hotel occupancy 
rate,  office  building  and  apartment  rental  rate  held  by  its  subsidiaries  due  to  the  impact  of  the  epidemic.  For  specific  water-saving 
measures, please refer to the chapter of "creating water-saving enterprises".111213The discharged is domestic wastewater.14The sharp decrease of glass recycling in 2020 is mainly due to the fact that the company's hotels and conference centres and otherenterprises have carried out floor decoration and replacement of cups and other conference supplies in 2019, resulting in the increase ofglass recycling in 2019. However, they have not carried out decoration or replacement in this Reporting Period, and the amount of incoming
